Description
============

‘my2cents’ is a platform that aims to make employee engagement a vital metric in business strategy by making feedback more accurate, precise, and real-time.

The idea was born from the realization that corporations either don’t value employee engagement enough to measure it, or are using ineffective methods for today’s rapidly changing business climate

Challenges
==================

Developing an app that looked good both on mobile and desktop platforms was challenging. Ensuring that employee data remained anonymous was a fun challenge that we had to keep revisiting with every feature we implemented. Ultimately we invested a lot of time in ensuring our backend only returned information to appropriate users.
